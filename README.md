## Work with Git/GitHub

*NOTE:* Depending on your operating system, you might have to install Git manually before using it with RStudio. You will find detailed instructions [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN).

## Clone this course's repository

1. In RStudio, navigate to a folder on your hard-disk where you want to have a local copy of this course's GitHub repository.
2. In RStudio, switch to the Terminal, and type the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/umatter/BigData.git
```

This creates a new directory `BigData` with all the course material in it.
Whenever there are some updates to the course's repository on GitHub, you can update your local copy with:
```
git pull
```
(Make sure you are in the `BigData` folder when running `git pull`.)
